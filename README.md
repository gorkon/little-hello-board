# little-hello-board

This is a very simple board, based on the ATtiny45 microcontroller. It has a button and two LEDs. One version has an FTDI connector for serial communications.

This is based on the PCB production processes and microcontroller programming taught in [Fab Academy](http://fabacademy.org/).
